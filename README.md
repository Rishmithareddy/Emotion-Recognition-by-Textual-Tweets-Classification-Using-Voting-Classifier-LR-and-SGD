The proliferation of user-generated content on social media has made opinion
mining an arduous job. As a microblogging platform, Twitter is being used to collect
views about products, trends, and politics. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to
analyse the attitude, emotions and opinions of different people towards anything, and
it can be carried out on tweets to analyse public opinion on news, policies, social
movements, and personalities. By employing Machine Learning models, opinion
mining can be performed without reading tweets manually.
Their results could assist governments and businesses in rolling out policies,
products, and events. Seven Machine Learning models are implemented for emotion
recognition by classifying tweets as happy or unhappy. With an in-depth comparative
performance analysis, it was observed that proposed voting classifier (LR-SGD) with
TF-IDF produces the most optimal result with 79% accuracy and 81% F1 score. To
further validate stability of the proposed approach on two more datasets, one binary
and other multi-class dataset and achieved robust results.
